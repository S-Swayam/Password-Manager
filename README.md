When you run the program for the first time, youâ€™ll be prompted to set up a master password.

The master password must meet strong security requirements:

At least 8 characters.

Contains uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.

You can either enter your own password or generate a strong, random one.

Enter the account name and provide a new username (optional) and password.

Choose a file name and decide whether to export in encrypted or plain-text format.

If exporting in plain-text, youâ€™ll need to enter the master password for verification.

7. Exiting the Program
Choose the Exit option to close the password manager.
